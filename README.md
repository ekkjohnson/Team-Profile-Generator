# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Your Task

I built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I wrote a unit test for every part of my code and ensured that it passes each test.



## User Story
